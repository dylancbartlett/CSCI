The program is a definition test. When the program is ran it will give a printout asking the user what list they would like. After you enter a list it will proceed to give the test. After the test is over it will print out a score.

System.out.println("To use this program you will need to select a list.");
			System.out.print("Please enter 1, 2, 3, or 4: ");
			int list = input.nextInt();
			input.nextLine();
		if (list < 5) {
			System.out.println("You have chosen list " + list + ". Letâ€™s get started!");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("This is not an option.");
This section of code is allowing the user to select a list. The input.nextint(); is the one that takes the number the user enters. The input.nextLine(); is making it so when you press enter it doesn't count as a character. The if else statements are making sure you are picking a list that exists. 

int potato = 0;
		if (list == 1) {
			for (int a = 0; a < 8; a++) {
				System.out.println(definitions[a][0] + " ");
				String answer1 = input.nextLine();
				
				if (answer1.equalsIgnoreCase(array[a][0])) {
					System.out.println("Correct!");
					potato++;
				}
The integer potato is your score at the beginning it will be set to 0 and one will be added with the potato++ each time you get one right. The if statement checks to make sure you entered list one and then the for loop starts. The println prints out the definition and a space and then string answer1 is the word or words that you choose to enter. The second if statement compares string answer1 to the array with the correct answers. This code is used for all 4 lists with a few numbers substituted. 

This project exists because some people would like to improve their vocabulary and some teachers require it. I always had a hard time with this in school so i created this. 

To use this program you will enter a list number after being promoted. Then you will proceed to put a word that matches the definition. That is basically all you have to do.
